    <h1>MY SKILLS</h1>

    <h2>Time Management</h2>
        <p>-For me, time management is all about organizing my day so I can get things done without feeling stressed or rushed. 
        I try to focus on what’s most important first, making sure I tackle those tasks before anything else. 
        Planning ahead, like jotting down a quick to-do list or setting up a simple schedule, helps me stay on track. 
        I also make it a point to avoid distractions, like my phone, so I can concentrate better. 
        Taking short breaks is essential too—it helps me stay refreshed and keeps me from burning out. 
        And I’m learning that it’s okay to say no when I’ve got too much on my plate. 
        For me, time management is really about finding a balance that lets me get my work done, enjoy my free time, and avoid feeling overwhelmed. </p>
        
    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
       <p>-For me, emotional intelligence is about really understanding what I’m feeling and why, and being able to manage those emotions so they don’t take over. 
            It means staying calm when things get tough and not letting my emotions control my reactions.
             It’s also about being able to sense what others are feeling and showing empathy—like putting myself in their shoes to understand their perspective.
              Having good social skills is part of it too, like communicating clearly, resolving conflicts smoothly, and building strong connections with people. 
              For me, emotional intelligence is about being in tune with my emotions and using that awareness to connect with others in a more meaningful way. </p>
    
    <h2> Basic Home Maintenance </h2>
        <p>-It's about knowing how to take care of the place where I live.
         It starts with simple things like cooking meals and keeping the house clean, so it feels comfortable and welcoming. 
         I’ve also learned to handle small repairs, like fixing a leaky faucet or changing a lightbulb, so I don’t always have to rely on someone else. 
         Taking care of the yard or plants, if I have them, is another part of it—just making sure everything stays in good shape. 
        It’s all about being able to handle the everyday stuff around the house, so things run smoothly and I feel more independent.</p>
